## Overview<a name="overview"></a> ##
This is a project in Udacityâ€™s AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree comparing the training of data between a simpler CNN model from scratch and a pre-trained deep neural network model.

Two machine learning models: a *CNN with no pre-trained data*, and a *deep neural network with pre-trained data*, are put to the test to identify and classify landmarks based off of pictures.

The dataset consists of pictures from 50 labelled landmarks and separated into `test` and `train` for training validation.

The goal of this project is to compare the *performance* of the two models and the *convenience* between using these models.

The CNN model test accuracy is **56%** (697/1250) whereas the test accuracy on a pre-trained ResNet18 model is **74%** (909/1250).

The advantage of pre-trained weights for deep neural networks is that the model is quickly able to identify features vital to identify landmarks accurately and predict the location.

The CNN model is a simpler network that was able to classify more than half of the images correctly without any pre-trained weights. The model has a drawback of not being able to converge any further.

The ResNet would require a lot of training time and data to generate the weights to achieve a similar accuracy. However, transfer learning removes that inconvenience allowing the model to train on a custom dataset.
